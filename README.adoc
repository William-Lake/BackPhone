= BackPhone

_A small Java Utility to see who called you._

== Notes

* PhoneChecker was built with https://github.com/mabe02/lanterna[Lanterna] as it's primary UI. As a result, it doesn't use a cursor to navigate between its two primary controls.
* The results are gathered from the following resources:
** https://www.advancedbackgroundchecks.com/
** https://www.fastpeoplesearch.com/
** http://www.okcaller.com/
** https://www.phonesearchfree.com/
** https://www.spytox.com/
